            <h2>Welcome.</h2>
            <p><strong>Rowledge Tennis Club</strong> is a small, 2 court club adjacent to a busy recreation ground in the centre of Rowledge Village. Although small, the club puts out several teams in the Aldershot and District LTA all year round and has over 200 members.</p>
            <p>Our coaching programme also has over 100 players receiving coaching weekly. Whether local or from another village, join and enjoy tennis at two very well maintained and ideally located courts.</p>

            <h2>The new clubhouse</h2>
            <p>After many many months of planning and fundraising, the new clubhouse is finally being built!  The project started at the beginning of April and will hopefully take 10 weeks.</p>
